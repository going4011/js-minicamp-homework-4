# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Callback Functions
	--A function that is used in another function as an argument. Usually to be executed after some sort of event happens. (click, hover, etc)
	* Closure
	--Nested functions have access to variables that are declared in their outer scope, however, they don't have access to the local variables of functions that are nested within them. Children "inherit" variables from their parents, but not the other way around.
	* arguments array
	--One can pass as many arguments as they want into a function. These arguments are stored in an array which can be manipulated with the word arguments. This way, functions can be used with any number of arguments if needed.
	* recursion
	--This is when a function is calling itself.
	* prototype
	--Making one object a prototype of another object will allow the first to inherit the second one's properties/methods.
	* constructors
	--A special function that explains to the computer what kind of an object that you'd like to be able to make so that it can be called later to make one (or a number of) said objects. Generally named with a capital letter.

2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
